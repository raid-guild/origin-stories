# Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! File not found.

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9. 95 a minute. But I've never been to the moon! And I'd do it again! **And perhaps a third time!** _But that would be it._ Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

## No, she'll probably make me do it.

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Bite my shiny metal ass. Ooh, name it after me! Say it in Russian! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

1. Shinier than yours, meatbag.
2. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
3. Look, last night was a mistake.

### I love you, buddy!

With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! File not found. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I just told you! You've killed me!

-   I can explain. It's very valuable.
-   I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
-   Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.

File not found. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Shut up and take my money!

So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Moving along… No argument here. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? But I've never been to the moon! Soothe us with sweet lies. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

Large bet on myself in round one. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Shut up and take my money!

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Oh God, what have I done? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Then we'll go with that data file!

Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Oh yeah, good luck with that. Ask her how her day was. Professor, make a woman out of me.

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Well, then good news! It's a suppository. What are their names?

Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…
