#### Travis Wyche
Maybe we can start with you describing how you transitioned to working into Web3 and maybe what you were doing before? 

#### Sam
Yeah. So I guess to lay some context. I'm 23 years old, I graduated college at the end of 2019. And so as you know, that's right when COVID started, so I entered the job force at a really strange time. I was applying for a lot of traditional software companies in the Web2 space. I ended up getting a job at a company called Celsius network, which is basically a crypto bank. I worked there for about six months doing data analysis and I wrote the weekly company newsletters. I did a lot of different research and strategy things on top. So I got to work on a cool project to get a virtual bank set up inside of decentraland and that was a really cool project. At the end of my internship they told me what I had done was great, but they were really looking for someone who can work with Python and SQL.
 
I wasn't blindsided by that because I knew that's what they wanted eventually. But also through my internship, they never gave me any training on how to learn those things!

#### Travis Wyche
What was your degree in?

#### Sam
I studied Econ, and I minored in finance, and politics. I also studied development, global poverty, international law on human rights, a lot of geopolitics, international security and the environment. So there's a lot like cross disciplinary study that I also did a permaculture course, my freshman year. I really wish I would have stuck with that because I find that a lot of those principles have stuck around throughout my life.

#### Travis Wyche
Oh, yeah. I could jam with you on that, for sure.

#### Sam
Yeah, and that's awesome. Finding my way to Web3 was strange, because I actually joined as a Raid Guild member in June of 2020. As you know I got hired as an intern by Celsius in August of 2020. And just around that time, I was actually about to write the August edition of ‘State of the Raid’ newsletter. But the reason I didn't was because I kind of needed a full time position at a company, or at least I thought I did. I was still living with my parents during this time, because it was COVID. So, I need to get a stable paying job, a salary and so forth.  But after that whole internship experience, after not being hired by Celsius, at the end of the day, which was really strange. It made me realize that I had a really strong ability to engage with the community through telegram chats and actually working with the community on projects was really interesting. So it kind of just was really natural for me to transition into Raid Guild, because I was already playing this non technical role in the crypto space and I was doing some data oriented stuff. 

I'm really intrigued by DAOs and Web3 and these organizations that can operate irrespective of geography or even the kind of physical confines that a company can sometimes put on its employees, whether it be like working in a particular region or having to visit an office once a week. 

#### Travis Wyche  
How did you find Raid Guild?

#### Sam  
I found Raid Guild through Dekan, Ven and SAM. I met those guys at Y.O. hack in 2019 where we worked on a DAOhaus little hackathon project together. At that time, I didn't really even like it was strange, because I didn't understand what DAOhaus was at that time. And it was only after I got involved in Raid Guild that I got involved in DAOhaus. But in reality, I think it's kind of interesting, because the DAO conversation has always been more interesting to me.

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah. Cool. So this might sound like kind of a mundane question. But, I feel like these interviews are actually going to generate some pretty interesting answers. What does an average workday look like for you? 

#### Sam  
That's a really good question, it's actually varied more recently. I think that's because I've been doing some of this Mcon organizing for a while. For those of you who are listening, that's the meta cartel conference that's happening in September. Because I'm living in Denver, I've felt kind of the responsibility and a little pressure to find things and cool places that people can go to while they're here in Denver. 

A part of my work now, because of that, has been like me going to different venues and trying to see if they would be willing to allow us to host events as well as community gathering stuff. So just last night, I met with Dekan, Peter Pan, Sam Coleman, and some other people from the crypto space in Colorado. That was really neat, to be able to go and do that. It wasn't really for my work, but it was a good decompress after the work day. 

>**I'm starting to find that my work and normal life outside of work are starting to really bleed into each other. I think that's what DAOs are supposed to actually enable! For you to live the truest version of yourself. And to genuinely want to be here, contributing value in whatever way you can. Right?**
 
And if that's not what you want to do, then you don't have to be here! Nobody's holding you here. You're not in a contract. You can make it whatever you want. 

>**The difficulty about it actually is being able to put your foot on the brake and say, "No, I need time for myself."**

I need to, you know, go out and do self reflection or do self help better.. 
 
I've always been told that I am more mature for my age, just from the standpoint of being independent. I cook my own food and I do a lot of my own stuff and maybe that's why I'm in the DAO space! There's kind of those interesting questions that I think about such as, how did your lifestyle influence you to get to the point where you're now working in a DAO? And how did the DAO now influence your lifestyle to improve itself?

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah, absolutely. It's an interesting barrier of entry, also, like a vetting for the community because some people want that siloed lifestyle, they want to be able to work nine to five, and know where the boundaries are, and then know when they get off work, they can drink some beers or go home and do whatever else and they have their own private life. And that schema, those territories, having that separation is important. And yeah, it's crypto, but it's really specifically DAOs, as a community, you just get sucked in. And if you don't love it, and if you're not really fully committed to seeing how deep that rabbit hole goes, you can lose your life in it. I could see that. 

#### Sam  
I think what's also interesting is that there's not a single model to really do this DAO work. I think the variation in the diversity is actually what makes it so much more exciting and I'm really interested. I think it's fascinating because they are kind of a mix of  traditional startup and software business. 

>**A lot of startups have their goals to raise a lot of money quickly and maybe get bought out by someone in the future. That is not at all the ethos of the DAO space.**

So I'm curious to see how the evolution, creation and maintenance of the DAO space happens. How DAOs integrate with other DAOs is like M&A and generally questions like that are interesting, but I get lost in those.

#### Travis Wyche  
Absolutely. Yeah. So how are you going on raids these days? Do you typically find that you are seeking to join raids? Or could you even remember your first raid?

#### Sam  
Yeah. Well, my first raid was Liquidy. I was going as a designer on that. Initially when I joined the Guild, I really wanted to get into design. Because I didn't have those technical skills that I wanted to have and this was before I worked at Celsius. So I was doing some low fi wireframing and mockups. But that raid ended up with the client never even paying. This was before we even had the consultation process set up. I don't know why exactly we began working ahead of the client, but we did. That was my first introduction to Raids. But currently a lot of the work I've been doing has been more clericing(account management) and then some project management consulting, 
About a month ago I went on a raid for the Simple Phi community, which was really interesting. I was really actually hoping to work on that a lot more but it was kind of disappointing, because there were some issues with the client and just moving things along. Sometimes I think there are some miscommunicated expectations at the beginning of a raid. But in this case, the issue was the way the proposal was drafted as well as what the needs of the client were at the time the proposal was drafted versus when funds were actually being held in escrow and work was being done. So there's sometimes that misalignment that occurs, which can slow projects down. 
 
The best way to prevent that in my experience is just by having clear communication from the beginning and having a point of contact that the client is always communicating with. On that project, at the start, we had JoshisDoug, an account manager, he took on the client, and then he  invited me to come in on it as a kind of co-cleric which made structuring the proposal a little confusing. We had a lot of back and forth with the client and sometimes as a cleric, it's important to recognize what the client is asking for, otherwise it gets really frustrating. We couldn't actually give the client what was expected and initially we did something else, and that something else was a strategy sprint. But then we determined that we didn't want to do that strategy sprint until after we had conducted a survey. We sent out a survey to a bunch of raid guild people, a bunch of people in the DAO space, and a lot of people in the defi space. The goal of that survey was to understand why defi users do or do not use a portfolio tracking app to track ROI is or zap into different investments.

#### Travis Wyche  
Basically it sounds like the client came to you wanting a final product. And you had to say, hey, before we get there, we need to strategize to make sure it's the right product. Before we strategize, we have to do some UX research. 

#### Sam  
Exactly. The first version of the website was supposed to be released in June and we were supposed to have that by the end of doing surveys so we can do in depth user experience research on the actual app. That would have at least given us something to show the community. Falling off the back of that we were going to do this community management kind of thing for Simplify to help them to start bringing in new community members, and also build out their contributor base. Which was all great. Those were all great ideas and all things I would have loved to work on. But we didn't have an application! We didn't even have a small number of community members that were ready to work on that with us?

#### Travis Wyche  
I mean, in light of this scenario that you found yourself in, could you maybe distill it down more generally to what you have found to be the biggest challenge that you've faced since pivoting to Web3, for example? 

#### Sam  
Oh , wow. 

#### Travis Wyche  
Is that too grandiose?

#### Sam  
It's really big. But I think that's a good question. 

#### Travis Wyche  
Let me tack on another one to it. I mean related to the biggest challenge. I'm wondering if you might maybe identify an aha moment in these proceedings? 

#### Sam  
Yeah, I think there is an aha moment that is in there. I guess what it would probably be is just that coordination is hard. Coordination is really difficult.

You cannot come here thinking anything else because if you do, you put yourself at risk of maybe burning out spreading yourself too thin. Doing the things that the guild is constantly telling you ! Be conscientious of this. The aha, I guess it's not really an aha, but it's more like just keep your head straight.

>**Create some definition around what you're doing because if you don't, then it's just going to be a kind of scramble of different initiatives or projects you're taking on that won't progress how you'd like them to, without that kind of mental model or mental map to be able to tackle those things.**

Now, I don't think I have it perfectly resolved in my own head yet and sometimes I like to make an example of myself, because I do see others dealing with similar questions in their own heads and their own minds about how to do what we are doing. So sometimes it's just best to really not be afraid to share what is on your mind and what projects you're working on? where you might be able to use help or even just realizing when it's right for you to take a step away and take a break from these things. But just being open, general openness to the community, and to your own feelings and emotions is really important for anyone to be able to kind of thrive and I think really reconcile the life you want to live with the life that you're living.

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah. I think that's sound advice. So if you could do it all over again. Of course, hindsight is 2020. But if you could do it all over again, is there anything that you would do differently?

#### Sam  
Gosh, that's a really awesome question, too. I actually don't really think so. **The thing I would do differently is be more like a single initiative driven and not be so spread out.** Which is interesting. I think there's a balance there that needs to be met. 

>**When I was in the Web2 world, I was very easily able to focus on several tasks. Now I find myself putting on these different hats constantly and it's sometimes really difficult to figure out if the hat you're wearing, when you're wearing it, is the right hat!**

Sometimes it’s being able to feel where you are in the different layers of social coordination and organization. I think if you're able to do that then it's really awesome. It's kind of a superpower, in a way, I think. 
 
Humans are highly intelligent species. I don't give myself enough credit, because I know I'm a smart person. however sometimes it just doesn't feel like that. But when you're in this DAO space, and you're coordinating across different groups about similar or different things.

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah, well, these are millennia old problems. This isn't just like something that was invented in the last 20 or 30 years. Human coordination is the problem of civilization. It's the problem of democracy or of just politics. So there is such an intense complexity there that necessitates this interpersonal, you know, an extension beyond yourself. That is, yeah, it's, it's mind boggling. It makes the head spin.

#### Sam  
I think what is particularly intriguing is the fact that there is no definition to these organizations! Maybe there is a little definition but in comparison to the traditional world where physical infrastructure exists, like, the definition comparison, there's nothing. So it's this big blank canvas, or big tent and a blank canvas. We are here to make the space what we want it to be. It's daunting, but incredibly exciting! And you're right, It's an age-old question. Coordination is always going to be central to our inability or ability to solve core problems to our existence.
 
>**What is particularly interesting about these DAOs is the lack of definition, the possibility for diversity, the possibility for complexity. Because within that kind of framework, especially when it's completely networked, like we are, the effects can be really incredible and spread across borders, as we've seen, impacting lives in hundreds of countries.**

Aligning individuals across different cultures and ethnic groups and traditions. That power is something we haven't seen yet. The digital nation state has been forming and I think it's self regulated and we don't know what it's gonna turn into!

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah, let's, let's save a little bit of that for when we get to DAOhuas/Uberhaus relations too. I feel like that's an excellent jumping off point for speculating wildly into the future. But just to finish up the freelancing section where you know, you're you've already given a great account of your experience that's full of tips and tricks, but do you have any final tips or tricks that you might offer specifically to new cohorts, new initiates or I guess, apprentices regarding how they might succeed in onboarding to Raid Guild? 

#### Sam  
>**I would say to new folks, just don't ever be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid  to make mistakes. Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.**



I would also say, it would be super helpful for you as a new member to document your process. Cuz that's something I wanted to do, but didn't do. Harry Martin did it from Season 0 and that's something we are totally happy to share on Twitter and put on our Medium, or in our Substack. Any kind of personal stories coming into Raid Guild, such as what was your experience through the onboarding process, what it's like getting integrated into a team working on a project? What's it like to work on a rip or a raid? All those things would be, I think, valuable.

Another tip is just try new things. Don't get stuck in doing one thing, if you're finding that you are frustrated or stressed out at work or if you're finding that clericing or being an account manager isn't for you don't do it. Try something else. Be a writer or just work on ops or be a bard and do treasury stuff. There's so much room for being able to participate and add value.

#### Travis Wyche  
Nice. So what are your roles in the Raid Guild? And? I mean, how would you describe them? Like your idiosyncratic combination of roles? How would you describe it to an apprentice? 

#### Sam  
I think I have like, maybe six or seven roles. Raid Guild encourages you to start by picking one or two, and then just kind of grow as you go along and add roles as you move. 

>**But basically, I'm a tavern keeper, which is the community role. So the way I see that is you're kind of the last line of defense for your community members. When they're having any friction points or any issues or anything related to Raid Guild, or towards our clients or members, really anything Raid Guild related, Tavern keepers are supposed to be there to help them to answer any questions they have and just be there as kind of a supporting actor.**

That role I haven't been super active in but the person who I've seen most successfully do that has been Yalor. Also people like Dekan, Scott and even Tae are awesome contributors who are flowing into that tavern keeper role and it's not incentivized. We talked about incentivizing that in the past, because the tavern keeper had a lot of responsibility such as answering the difficult questions that a lot of new members bring, especially when you are an organization that isn't super established. That was actually something that was kind of under review last summer in the summer of 2020. We see a community is a very important piece to Raid Guild and ensuring that we continue on track with our roadmap and our goal as a developer agency in the Web3 space.

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah, that seems important and a really fascinating conversation. I'd like to hear at some point about the progress on that. So would you say that that's your main role?

#### Sam  
Main role would probably be a scribe. So writing newsletters and documentation for Raid Guild, I've kind of taken a little step back, just because the way I see it, **when I'm contributing, I'm also learning.** I like to be a champion of the decentralization message when I am contributing and helping others contribute. I think it's important that we encourage other writers to write newsletters, or we encourage other writers to contribute to the handbook. So my goal and taking a step back a little bit is to let that emerge a little more and see who else is interested in it?

#### Travis Wyche  
cool, and then you're obviously a member of other DAOs. Would you list the major ones that you're a part of, and maybe the relationship between those DOAs and Raid Guild? 

#### Sam  
I am part of maybe six or seven DAOs. For Uber Paladins, my role there is more of an orchestrator/facilitator which includes putting together meeting agendas, making sure that we are making proposals to fund certain grants or certain initiatives on the DAOhaus platform. As well as doing some accountability and making sure that people are showing up to meetings, or delegates have at least attended meetings to distribute rewards. I really do a lot of the administration stuff. That's very different from my role, or the hat I wear at Raid Guild, where some work is operations focused, but honestly, Raid Guild is pretty self sufficient a lot of the processes are pretty well defined. It's just now being able to communicate those processes effectively and ensure that people can access those processes easily. 

I'm also in Rangers, which is a sub-DAO of Warcamp, and Warcamp is the core contributor DAO for DAOhaus. So in Rangers, I'm also kind of in a similar role to Raid Guild, I'm a writer or scribe focusing a lot on writing newsletters, drafting tweets, doing some announcement posts and helping with some discord moderation as well as helping with opinion pieces that have been written in collaboration with different media outlets now. Rangers is starting to focus more on the side of marketing and how to really do marketing in the DAO and track the growth of your user base or follower base. Those I think are all things that Rangers as well as Uber Paladins will be working on here pretty soon.

Then I'm also a part of Boost Foundry, which is another DAO in the DAOhaus ecosystem that's strictly focused on building out boosts for DAOs on the DAOhaus platform. Boosts are really just different apps that increase the functionality of your DAO, which is super cool. Basically, the reason I'm in there is it's actually a little complicated so I'm not going to get into it. But yeah, they're going to need some documentation eventually. So I figured I’d be in there, too.

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah, I see subtle differences, but also, you know, poignant distinctions between all those roles. There's a lot of overlap. But yeah, little idiosyncratic tweaks in each particular DAO.

#### Sam  
Yeah and then hopefully, I'll be joining Meta Cartel too. In there, that would probably be what I would do, there would be more of a community role. Probably wouldn't be doing a lot, but just kind of being there as a sponge, and also someone to answer questions.

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah. So how did you fall down the crypto rabbit hole? You mentioned this internship that was working on a crypto product, right?  And is that when you kind of got sucked in?

#### Sam  
Not exactly. I got sucked in when I was still in school. I was a sophomore at Regis in Denver, Colorado, which is a private liberal arts school. I had heard about Bitcoin, and I'm not really honestly sure where I heard about it. At this time, I was also studying, I was in both micro and macro economics as well as in international law and human rights in the first semester, sophomore year of college. I was really fascinated by economics, international trade, monetary policy, foreign exchange markets, central banks, international organizations, etc & really understanding the different levels at which coordination is taking place on the global scale.

Understanding that dollars are created through lending or to say that money is actually created through lending is basically what got me into understanding why Bitcoin's monetary policy was important. And really understanding that something that cannot be controlled by a central government. Then I got really interested in the idea of community currencies, like micro economies of scale. One of the largest reasons why our banking system and our economic system are fragile as they are is because of how lending takes place. Today, with interest based lending practices, they really end up creating a lot of debt at the expense of the poor and not the rich, which is really unfortunate. Basically it really comes down to the cost of borrowing capital and who can access those better rates in the market. Now, obviously, if you have a lot of money, you are going to be able to borrow at a much lower rate. So the cost of capital for bankers is a lot lower than it is for retail investors or individual people, or families, or the working class people. The way I understood it is that 

>**growth in the capital market that we know today, really is coming at the expense of the everyday laborer because value is being extracted at a level that they don't have control over.**

So understanding that made me want to think about a different currency model or system that wasn't in the control or in the hands of the government or a few groups of a few individuals. It's just, it doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't make sense to a lot of people. 

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah. So you pursued crypto as an alternative model? 

#### Sam  
Yeah. So that brought me into the rabbit hole. But I'm still trying to reconcile a lot of my understanding with some of the traditional forms of economics and all the different kinds of social economic systems that exist, but we don't really talk about. Because there are a lot of different models that can be taken and learned from. I don't think we've arrived at the model that is right for us yet.

#### Travis Wyche  
Absolutely I mean, on that note, I got a, I got a question for you. From your perspective of being a member of all these different DAOs, and from this very well informed and intentional way of entering into crypto, what would you say constitutes a healthy DAO? 

#### Sam  
That's a really interesting question. 

>**I would say what constitutes a healthy DAO is an ecosystem or community of individuals who are aligned by means that are economic or merit based to achieve a set of common goals together.  And what determines the success of that is participation, growth and engagement.**

I think those are the two things if you have participants dropping off or rage quitting, or leaving your community then your DAO is obviously not successful.

#### Travis Wyche  
Well, I mean, if these people are participating, coordinating based on either economic or meritus contribution, certainly this is rooted in issues of trust, and loyalty, as well, right. I mean, how would you describe trust and loyalty in Web3?

#### Sam  
Yeah, I would say it's probably actually one of the most important aspects of the work that we're doing. I think that's actually really interesting too, because the reason a lot of us got into the space was to disintermediate that trust and to make it easier to not have to trust somebody. 
 
But 
>**a lot of the actual positives or benefits of being in a DAO, I think, is the ability to create more intimacy and more relationships instead of it just being a protocol where you and I are interacting with each other. We're actually using this infrastructure to build value, and relationships with each other.** 

So I yeah, I see. I see that as probably one of the most important and valuable aspects to being a contributor to a DAO.

#### Travis Wyche  
Yes, absolutely. I couldn't agree more. So that being said, what does the future of coordination look like to you from your vantage,

#### Sam  
I expect to see a world where we are able to collaborate amongst one another in a permissioned fashion where we are not forced to trust each other. We can easily exit out at any time without placing a major burden on any of the other individual members. Basically, this idea I was alluding to earlier of self regulation, I think that's going to be a key piece to establishing these organizations in the future, and how they can create precedents for this new digital like nation.
 
We can have our own( I don't know if it's our own) legal system. We can have our own laws as an organization that might be respected by other organizations or the way I see it is that we are moving to a global world.  We have already globalized now, we're kind of de-globalizing, I don't really know where we are at. But what I do know is from a cultural perspective, and also technological perspective, we have the ability to share and engage in ways that we never have been able to before. I think part of that possibility is ushering in a new way to innovate, to engage in community and building relationships with people from all over the globe, to learn from other cultures about what we are doing wrong, and how we could be doing things better. I think all of this diversity allows for a better world at the end of the day. I think it makes us all smarter. 

I don't know what coordination is gonna look like exactly in the future but I'm hoping to see a model that is more inclusive and diverse. Hopefully it's more idealistic & in line with where we are as a civilization. In the 21st century we have done just about everything. We've committed just about every atrocity. We've done just about every innovation. That's not exactly true. Innovation never ends, but our history is only as long as we are old and we are living in the present. So effectively, we have the most information about both the past and the future of where we're going. So I think that we should be able to be more effective in coordinating on the things that we're trying to solve. 

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah. That's a very optimistic outlook. I appreciate that. I would say innovation never ends until there's some kind of catastrophic global crisis due to geo engineered coordination failure.

#### Sam  
 Yeah, exactly. That's yeah. So that that would be the end of innovation or even a, like, kind of a, like diminished or deteriorated version of like, okay, now, now we're back to ground, or like, square one, right with coordination 

#### Travis Wyche  
Right. Yeah. Cool.
