#### Travis Wyche
So let's start maybe with the freelance part. How did you transition to working in Web3? What were you doing before?

#### Elliott Conway
I was freelancing before with Web2 stuff, just doing Web2 web development, plus I had a full-time job managing a media studio and also doing web development for that company. 

I first  became aware of people working on Web3 stuff in late 2017. So I spent 2018, researching as much as I could and conceptually trying to get a hold of what it actually was, which takes a surprising amount of time to do! Maybe it's easier for people starting now. But there's a lot of conceptual work that has to be put in, I feel like, to even get started on this kind of stuff. So it was a year of just really being interested in the concept surrounding Web3, and really liking the stuff that Web3 people were talking about. And I don't think I made any real contributions to any like open source web three stuff until like 2019. And I basically, so I really loved Aragon, in 2018, and 2019. And  I thought it was basically like the coolest project that ever existed. And so in 2019, I just really wanted to contribute some sort of cred to that. I think near the end of 2019, I actually started getting commits pushed into like their UI. That was pretty exciting and I think just through starting doing that, and then contributing to a couple of other projects like Metagame and hackathons like Web3 hackathons just eventually led me to somehow stumble upon Raid Guild. I didn't really do full-time Web3 freelancing until I officially joined Raid Guild. It's hard to even remember exactly how I joined Raid Guild but I have been doing that ever since.

#### Travis Wyche 
Nice. That's actually the next question. I'd be very curious to see how you might recall first finding out about Raid Guild and joining the ranks.

#### Elliott Conway 
I remember it was an year and a half ago, I was contributing to Aragon and they had this program called Aragon experts. In 2020, my goal was to quit my full-time job and just do freelancing. I told myself that I'm gonna spend one year doing 50% of my time as Web3 and 50% as Web2 and hopefully, the Web3 stuff will eventually equal the web2 stuff, in terms of actually supporting me financially.

Meanwhile, Aragon came up with this program called Aragon experts, which was a way for other people to hire out developers to develop on top of Aragon or something along those lines. So I thought, this would be a great thing to apply to people who want to build on top of Aragon and they can hire me out and I can build on top of Aragon for them. Then I saw that Yalor put Raid Guild down as an organization for that program, I checked out that application and through that I just found Raid Guild and immediately loved it. 
The whole space has a lot of crossover with people and ideas. So finding Raid Guild was also bolstered by the fact that there was a similar ethos between Metagame and Raid Guild and the people actually kind of swapped in between. There was this cohesive community, and different pockets of people working almost interchangeably between these different projects. After applying to be an apprentice, I started by contributing to two projects and also did a hackathon for Near, shortly after that! After that hackathon, I think Yalor asked me if I wanted to join and I think he championed me and this happened kind of suddenly over the course of a month.

#### Travis Wyche 
Very cool. So in what capacity are you contributing? Are you a developer? You mentioned UI. Are you auditing the visual design systems or working on UI UX?

#### Elliott Conway
It's primarily front-end work, back-end work, Web3 stuff, and project management.

#### Travis Wyche 
Excellent. I'm just curious, are you still working in the Web2 sphere as well? Or have you transitioned to full Web3 now?

#### Elliott Conway 
It's pretty much full Web3. I can't just drop the Web2 stuff that I've worked on. So you know, things will come up. It's hard to say no to like making additions to something that I basically built. So there's still stuff like holdovers from previous projects from the past.

#### Travis Wyche 
That's good. I hope that's a positive remembrance, not projects coming back to haunt you.

#### Elliott Conway 
It depends, for some projects you go back to the codebase and you have to decide whether or not you want to change everything, or just like, keep it. If it's a two-year-old project, you have to decide whether or not you want to upgrade everything, or just keep it as apparently hacky as you made it at the time. 

#### Travis Wyche  
Totally. So these days, while you're juggling all this, what does an average workday look like for you?

#### Elliott Conway  
It is usually waking up reading emails and messages I missed in the night because everyone has different time zones. Then, at least in the last couple of months, it's just like meetings in the morning. Usually it’s like going from communication stuff  in the morning to meetings then meetings and then PR review stuff. Finally, because of the business recently, I can't actually do any development until late afternoon or in the evening. But that should be changing soon as projects close.

#### Travis Wyche 
Yeah, time is becoming a scarce resource in and of itself, so much communication, so much coordination is required?

#### Elliott Conway 
It's amazing how much time just meetings can take up. 
>**I definitely have learned recently to hone in on particular projects, rather than being a part of a bunch of projects all at once.** 

Because it can be pretty taxing, trying to spread yourself. Even if you're not doing a lot with other projects, just having that kind of mental space and having to keep up with any updates with it every day or a couple of times a week is taxing. So it has definitely been a struggle trying to figure out what to kind of focus on recently.

#### Travis Wyche 
That seems like a solid tip, actually, for any Freelancer but especially here in Web3 or, especially with Raid Guild. I'm wondering, are you actively seeking new raids to join? Or if your plate is full? 

#### Elliott Conway 
I've promised myself not to take on any new raids for a month to two months.

#### Travis Wyche 
That's good. I mean, that there's such an abundance. You know, I think  that really says something, it really speaks to the culture that is developing here.

#### Elliott Conway  
It's definitely a unique circumstance to be in. Most problems people have are not getting enough work, so it's a weird problem to have. Way too much work and the struggle of making the mistake of taking too much on or or trying to figure out what to say no to and what not.so It’s a perfect time for more raiders to hop in from the cohort.

#### Travis Wyche 
On that note, what do you think has been the biggest challenge that you have faced since pivoting into this community?

#### Elliott Conway
>**I think the biggest things were conceptual things. It takes a lot of time just to read through stuff and understand particular concepts that are totally foreign. The second big hurdle was probably that there are many things that are not documented very well, for developers in Web3, but we are getting better with documentation. Especially new stuff isn't well documented, and especially stuff back then it wasn't well documented. I think there's a difference between Web3 and Web2, in that you have to learn to find projects to mimic rather than googling stuff that you might be able to do in Web2 more easily or looking at documentation in Web2. There's a lot more you have to dig into. Finally, the biggest hurdle is just trying to figure out stuff to focus on. Because now, at least for the last like six months, it's been a bull market where there's an abundance of capital and projects. So now the challenge is figuring out what is worthwhile to spend your time on.**

#### Travis Wyche 
Yeah, absolutely. I really appreciate you describing that kind of steep learning curve of the conceptual on-ramp. One could spend a lifetime just ruminating around in that space.
Do you find as you're onboarding in that way that you've experienced, maybe an aha moment, whether in Web3, or with your participation in DAOs, or, I mean, maybe even Raid Guild specifically, some point where everything just kind of clicked.

#### Elliott Conway 
I think this might be the case for everyone, but there's just endless aha moments throughout; from the very beginning to even now. It's hard to say from a non-developer perspective, I'm sure it's the same thing where people are always continuously hitting aha moments, but for me, they always ended because of coming in from a developer perspective, all the aha moments had to do with implementation of certain ideas. One was just about finally realizing what proof of work actually was when I had it explained and I read about it endlessly, but I think it took a year and a half to really click what it was like & why is it generating this random number just uselessly. It took a while to understand that it literally is just a useless number. That is just something that the computer has to do to prove that it's working on it. From a developer perspective, I feel like there's like a ton of these kinds of things. Especially having to do with smart contract stuff. And if you are learning solidity at all, I think those come even more often

#### Travis Wyche  16:54  
Yeah, you hit the nail on the head just about aha moments, and generally, but so in realizing that, looking back, to your experience, would you say that there is anything if you could do it all over again? Anything that you would do differently? 

#### Elliott Conway
I guess one of the things is that you could kind of grapple with conceptual things earlier. So you can start contributing earlier? Or maybe I wish that I got involved earlier. 
>**I think the only thing I would do differently is just like starting earlier.** 

I'm pretty happy with at least having achieved the goal to do Web3 stuff full time. And I feel pretty happy that that's happened.

>**If you want to get involved with something don't wait on it, it would be the thing I would tell myself.**

#### Travis Wyche   
That sounds like sound advice. Still. I mean, are there any other tips that you might want to add off the top of your head tips or tricks, perhaps that you might offer to the next cohort of apprentices, or just any freelancer coming into the crazy Web3 space that might ensure their success?

#### Elliott Conway
In this space, I feel like you kind of have to have your own management system. Everything in Raid Guild, and I think generally with Web3 is kind of, almost seemingly voluntary and free, associative, and then everything's kind of loose. I've heard a lot of people get lost in first joining Raid Guild and not knowing what to do and feeling like they were supposed to get direction on where to go next. In some sense, you could say that is Raid Guild's fault, that maybe there isn't enough direction, once you get onboarded. I think I tend to be a little bit more towards the end of a filtering system where, if people figure out how to kind of make their own way, in this more free-associative, like organization, then I think you end up with better people. 
>**So I guess the tip would be like, figure out how to manage all of your stuff, almost independently, figure out your own system because the organization is never going to tell you how your schedule should be, how to log hours, or how to figure out how much time you're spending on something. You are never going to have to report any of that kind of stuff or input it into a system or have it tracked & everything.** 

I think the only way to do well in something that's as loose as Raid Guild is to have kind of a strong personal management system because there's no strong management system in Raid Guild.

#### Travis Wyche 
Yeah, that sounds solid, you're triggering all kinds of ideas. I feel like we could jam on that idea for a long time. I mean, on one hand, the filtering mechanism is a kind of competitive mechanism, which seems like a good proof, especially in working on the internet, where everyone's functioning with anonymous or autonomous avatars. It's hard to build trust. And that's one way of weeding people out. On the other hand, we're trying to execute these nonfragile systems. 

#### Elliott Conway 
I think two things that would work really well that have been talked about are 
>**if you champion someone, you're kind of their guide, during the first same month of being a Raid Guild.** 

I don't think (I at least personally, don't think) Raid Guild should come up with a tightly controlled thing where first you do this raid, and then you do this raid, and someone will be with you every step of the way, you'll get this kind of almost an advisor. However, I think just having the person who championed you is with you is a good solution. The first one basically has their reputation staked on your success. 
>**And then I think having resources available is super important.** 

So generally, the looseness of Raid Guild is kind of fun and there's something about having things kind of hard to find that's kind of fun. But at the same time, 
>**I think like having more resources, maybe not perfectly collected, but in a way where people have to go step by step through these kinds of things, but having them available for people to look at, I think is a good idea.** 

But this is also just my personality. Maybe other people would like it more to have the step-by-step thing.It's hard to figure out what will work for others because at this point, it becomes almost like a cultural question. What kind of culture an organization would you rather have? And that's just an ongoing conversation based on, you know, who's currently in the guild? 

#### Travis Wyche 
Yeah, that's right. But your perspective is very astute and well-articulated, and an important contribution to that conversation. And maybe by putting it all out there, we'll be able to understand how all that melds together exactly what kind of culture is being built. So I appreciate you saying that. So, let's move into the origin stories questions, then. This might be a little feel a little bit like starting over, but maybe you could articulate explicitly what your roles are within Raid Guild, you know, according to the Raid Guild nomenclature

#### Elliott Conway  
if I can get the nomenclature correct, I do paladin stuff, Monk stuff, And some backend stuff. So in summary its project managing stuff, front end stuff, which is Paladin and then back end.

On top of that, (I don't think this is a this is an actual role but) Web3 related stuff as well because I know there's sometimes with projects you have people who are like really good with react or TypeScript or can work with Express servers or whatever but then don't know how to work with ethers.js or Web3 at all or anything like that. So there's a little bit of a jump between someone who's just like a front-end person and someone who also knows how to work with Web3 libraries. 

#### Travis Wyche  
Are you a member of any other DAOs besides Raid Guild?

#### Elliott Conway  
Well, I used to contribute to Metagame. So I am still a patron just because of the seeds from that. So I just added liquidity with the seeds as a patron. So yeah, I am a patron of Metagame. So essentially, just like contributing to Raid Guild stuff, which is actually kind of nice. 
>**Raid Guild, I think, does a pretty good job of bridging with other communities. So it's easy to figure out what's going on with the DAO space just because it intermingles. We got the whole Meta Cartel community so it intermingles really well.** 

So I don't feel insulated, only doing Raid Guild stuff. 

#### Travis Wyche 
I would be very curious to hear from you your kind of narrative arc of how you fell into this crypto rabbit hole, maybe much more generally. 

#### Elliott Conway  
>**I think a lot of people who end up joining Web3 come at it from the same place as I did, which is coming at it from both an ideological point of view and a technical point of view.** 

After college, I actually worked at America's Funniest Home Videos for a year, kind of randomly, and I had a little bit of a moment of feeling like, ‘Hollywood is just kind of this grouping of companies that do a really good job of attracting talent to that physical location’. And there's a feeling that there probably won't be a central location for any media from now on because of distribution. Hollywood is just a center, it's just a collection of distribution companies but you don't have to be next to the distribution company anymore to be able to produce media so it's all kind of distributed now. And there was also a feeling of like, a person who's right out of college and thinking that working at a place is gonna be so much fun and just realize that, ‘oh man most organizations are kind of super slow, stringent, hierarchical and nontransparent and all these things that are a major letdown whenever you first like join them. 
As a kid I had a cynical view that I guess I determined that I really wanted to start a VR company, and I would want it to be a co-op because I thought co-ops were the answer to this fundamentally non-transparent and hierarchical and centralized form of organization. So I was really interested in co-ops and the only way to start a new kind of organization would be to start with a new technology. I just used VR for the first time around this time, which was in 2016 and it was the most amazing thing I've ever experienced. I want to do this forever. So through that ideological seed and that technical seed I started getting more involved in getting back into web development, which I had taught myself. In college, I did like Code Academy and some self learning in school. But the college I went to didn't really have a good programming course, or even a video game department, which I really missed while in college, because I probably would have been involved with that kind of thing. So I started back up and getting more involved in doing web development stuff at the same time trying to figure out more and more of the logistics of starting a co-op, and then eventually joined a startup in Pittsburgh, where I was managing a studio and basically building their website, redesign the websites from scratch, and then managing that and then started doing freelance web development work.
From that point on, and I guess around late 2017, or early 2018, whenever 
>**Ethereum hit its peak I was first learning about it and I was like, oh, “This is the thing, like this is the thing that is going to allow scalable co-ops to exist in a way that competes with other companies.”**
 
Aragon, in my mind, was like the perfect example of that use of Ethereum and I got drawn towards it. Aragon seemed like the only other thing since the DAO to really make their focus DAOs, like these transparent organizations where people are self-sovereign within them and share ownership and manage it democratically. It was like the only organization at the time that made that its focus and so I started contributing to that. Then I remember reading an article around like, 2019, maybe about Moloch DAO and from that Raid Guild spawned off. The main ideological and technical origin was just about following those two strands, and still really wanting to work on WebXR stuff like VR and AR stuff for web browsers & mixing that with Web3 stuff. I thought it’s really a cool and a very natural pair to have together so I basically started with those two things.

I remember reading Metagame’s Manifesto for the first time and being like, ‘Oh, this person just took a transcript of my thoughts and made a blog post out of it, and, but then articulated it better than me. So, it's amazing how many other people in this space follow the same mental tracks. In fact, I still don't know almost anyone like in my geographic area or friends I've had for the last few years who totally are on board with these ideas that everyone shares in the Web3 community. And so it's been cool to see everyone share the same seeds of thought and the same pathways of thinking about organizations, and, and so forth.

#### Travis Wyche
Yeah. I hear you, I relate to that a lot. Metagames' Manifesto and just all their documentation was one of my first introductions to the DAO space And it totally blew my mind equal parts, like psychedelic, and kind of like a critical theory manual for post-capitalist life. Very cool. Yeah. So I mean, on that note, I think I'm very curious to hear from you what you think constitutes a healthy DAO.

#### Elliott Conway
One thing I'm realizing that 
>**Raid Guild does really well that other organizations don't do very well is community.** 

The Raid Guild's mantra almost seems like this beautiful accident and it’s fascinating to see this community that has formed around it. I feel like a lot of it has to do with it being called Raid Guild with it's weird symbols, color scheme and overall style. I think it's another filtering mechanism where you find people around which the culture is formed. The name itself is like the evocation of D&D and one can automatically create the culture. I feel like a lot of organizations have this ‘tug of war’ with a bunch of different parties, over what the culture is going to be, however, I feel like Raid Guild almost accidentally fell into a community that already existed through a kind of meme. I guess that people already understood immediately the meme and they either hated it or liked it and joined. 
>**Generally, a healthy DAO, or any DAO that's trying to do Web3 stuff basically has to have a good community. They can be incredibly, technically talented and if the community is no good, it's not gonna really go anywhere.**

#### Travis Wyche 
That's right. Yeah, good answer. Certainly, a community, whether it's Web3 or IRL, or otherwise, whether it's, you know, Co-op, or otherwise, it's based on trust and loyalty. This is a real question, I think, for people coming into this space, whether they're transitioning from Web2, or whether they're here for the cultural ideals, the core cultural values that form the bedrock of this DAO ecosystem. I'm wondering how you might describe how that trust and loyalty is generated and maintained, or, or maybe just the importance of it as you see it.

#### Elliott Conway
I feel like, to a pretty good extent, it's like the most important thing, especially whenever you are interacting with avatars on the screen. 
>**When I first joined, I've had moments of both being like, holy cow, like, I can't believe this works like this! Everyone somehow works together, even though we don't have any idea really who everyone else is in any physical sense at all! At the same time, I can't believe this works & it feels almost like a dream come true.** 

At the same time, I think, there are moments of actually having difficulty working with people that you've never worked with before, whom you have never met & whom you've never seen or never talked to other than like once a week. 
>**So it seems like some component is missing in DAOs right now, which is why people have talked about it since the beginning, a sort of reputational-like system. I think that a huge aspect of trust within an organization is having some kind of reputational system that people find fair and which is democratically and automatically generated in real-time.** 

I think without that kind of real-time reputation being displayed to everyone, I still think there are moments where it can be hard to trust some people, but at the same time, it is amazing how the vast majority of the time it does work. I think it works well in Raid Guild because it does have that difficult barrier of entry in the sense of like, there's almost like a cultural barrier of entry. And like what we talked about just trying to figure out how to get onboarded, and how to contribute, there's difficulty there. If you actually get to the point where you feel like you can do stuff full time, say in Raid Guild, then I think you probably care a lot about it. And you're not going to throw it away too easily. So, yeah, I think it works well for Raid Guild, but could definitely use some reputation systems that do improve it.

#### Travis Wyche
Excellent. I'd love to hear you elaborate at some point about your particular vision of that reputation system. It's a hot topic, right? It's a hot topic in this community. And yeah, there are things that it's also being approached from various angles, different perspectives on what it should consist of, or what its MVP would consist of culturally or technically. 

#### Elliott Conway 
I guess I really liked SourceCred for the last few years. Theirs is more of a value like distribution system, but I feel like theirs was the first system where I was like, Oh, dang, this is, super well done in context of how to keep track of all that stuff, especially through like GitHub contributions is pretty unique. I'm not actually quite sure what they're doing now, or how often it's being used but I hope one day Raid Guild starts trying to use that kind of a system again. I think at some point they were trying to add it to the regular like repos. It would be cool to see maybe a future cohort try to tackle a Raid Guildified type of SourceCred thing or try to implement SourceCred in Raid Guild.

#### Travis Wyche 
So this brings me to my final question, Eliot. And it's a big one. But what, in your opinion, do you think the future of coordination looks like?

#### Elliott Conway 
Well, I feel like all you could do is hope for stuff and then try to build towards that thing. I would definitely say there's no guarantee towards anything. I mean, everything could go completely south and everything in Web3 could fall apart within a year, so there's definitely no guarantee of anything. 

It would be really awesome for scalable co-ops to exist in a way that competes better with traditional companies where the thought was like if co-ops can generate more value at scale than traditional companies, then, of course, traditional companies are going to start moving towards co-ops. And then, you have a system where decision-making is shared among everyone. It's more egalitarian and everyone has a stake in what they're building and ownership of what they're building. I hope that it continues in that direction. My ultimate hope is that it just continues to the point where legacy companies all of a sudden are like, ‘Oh! we need to shift gears’. Like fundamentally shifting internally with what they are doing or those legacy companies might just die out. There are just better forms of organizations that are both better at creating value because that's the only way that they would ever supersede traditional companies and ones that actually do better at treating consumers, owners and contributors, as a single entity where the distinction between all three of those groups of people is completely dissolved. But I'm not sure if that's a coordination thing. 
It'll be interesting to see what Raid Guild does coordination-wise as it gets bigger. The cohorts, I think, do a really good job of onboarding quite a number of people and getting them involved into this organization of more than 100 people. I hope Raid Guild just keeps testing out small things here and there and continues to figure out ways of growing without breaking themselves. I hope that things just continue in a way where organizations that share ownership and have democratic control scale in a way that competes with legacy companies.

#### Travis Wyche 
Yeah. Or maybe breaking ourselves faster, and better and more often to locate the weaknesses.

#### Elliott Conway
I remember first joining and being like, there's a chance that Raid Guild could fall apart. This was at the time when there were I think 60 people and I thought it could fall apart right around Dunbar's number. But at least if it did, people can go to our Discord, our repos & people could pick up the pieces in some way and figure out and I'm sure people in Raid Guild would spawn off and do their own thing. People from RG would spawn off their own things which would be built on the learning of the past. 
>**There are so many passionate people in Raid Guild that even if Raid Guild fell apart, the people who make it up could carry that kind of culture and build better things. So definitely won't even be a problem if Raid Guild fell apart. So yeah, maybe it is worth trying to break and iterate as fast as possible, even if it means breaking up a few shards or sharding entirely.**

#### Travis Wyche  
Yeah, nice. I don't see it going anywhere anytime soon. It just seems to be getting stronger and stronger, doesn't it?

#### Elliott Conway 
Yeah, no, I agree. I think my default is to be pessimistic about this stuff. But I guess, yeah, my honest opinion is that I don't think anytime soon it's gonna be going anywhere. But you have to be pessimistic to some degree. 

#### Travis Wyche
Nice. Well, that's all I have. Is there any final comment you'd like to add either in terms of Web3 Freelancer tips or as a final comment on your own origin story?

#### Elliott Conway  49:29  
I guess one final tip would be like, 
>**when you are trying to get into Web3 stuff there’s just dozens and dozens of times where you'll feel like you've hit this actual wall of, “I'm not gonna be able to figure this out” and if you keep up with something and whether or not it's building or designing a particular thing that seems like with Web3 is just impossible or way too clunky or conceptually difficult. Yeah, I would just say keep with it.**

A lot of the time it just ends up being like hours you put into it, like you just got to put as much time into something that is difficult that you can and the more time you put into it usually the more likely you are to get past it faster. But yeah, keep at stuff because there's definitely gonna be tons of walls throughout the path.
