#### Suede 
 
GM Plor. What are you excited about in your life? What gets you up in the morning?

#### Plor
  
Working on cool projects, new things that haven't been done before. Solving interesting problems, I have a puzzle-solving mindset. That's why I got into programming: to present myself with puzzles and solve them in reproducible ways so that other people can benefit from the solution.

#### Suede 
 
Do you carry any of that puzzle-solving outside of the tech sphere?

#### Plor
  
For games, I tend towards puzzle games, either logic puzzles or mystery-type stuff. Also, I'm into cooking – that's kind of a puzzle. I'm trying to work on my chili recipe; I keep tweaking the amounts of ingredients slightly. It's not quite the same type of puzzle but that's my current project, trying to get my chili recipe perfect.

#### Suede 
 
What are some of your other interests besides tech and programming?

#### Plor
  
I'm really into cheese. Back in the day, I co-founded a cheese club, which was a student group where we learned about and tasted cheeses. We tasted some of the best cheeses around, and I would like to do more of that. Also, I've been gardening, trying to get stuff to grow in my backyard, which is more difficult than I expected it would be. I think I need to improve the soil.

#### Suede 
 
Let's turn back toward tech and the blockchain. How did you fall down the crypto rabbit hole?

#### Plor
  
It was a slow fall. I first heard about Bitcoin when I had just started my first job out of college. While grabbing coffee with my coworkers, one of them brought up Bitcoin, likely from a forum he saw. I looked into it a bit and toyed around with it but didn't completely dive in. A few years later, I heard about it again due to the Silk Road, looked into it again, but still didn't buy any. Eventually, I did purchase some and held onto it for a couple of years, but I didn't consider it an investment. It was more like playing around with it. Then, during the 2017 cycle, I heard about Ethereum and connected it to my previous experience with Bitcoin. It was like, "Oh, I get this now; you can program on it and deploy your code to the blockchain." That led me down a deep rabbit hole where I learned Solidity, started building test projects on my own, and eventually joined Raid Guild, I think in 2020 or maybe early 2021. So, I went deep down the crypto rabbit hole sparked by Ethereum, but had a good foundation in Bitcoin history to start.

#### Suede 
 
What excites you about blockchain technology?

#### Plor
  
Essentially, it's the ability to have a shared database or a shared set of information that you can build upon. You don't need to trust the parties running it, which makes cooperation easier since you don't need one person managing the backend database. You can trust that they're not going to tamper with it or shut down their service. This introduces new use cases that weren't previously possible because you can release something that's shared, with permissions managed at that level, rather than by some sysadmin who can change the password.

#### Suede 
 
I heard you say that you like the immutability of a distributed ledger. Did I get that right?

#### Plor
  
Indeed, it's about immutability to a certain extent. But it's more about control. No one controls what is deployed, or you can arrange it so that no one controls what is deployed. This allows you to trust that there aren't special privileges for certain parties.

#### Suede 
 
How did you transition into working in Web3? And what were you doing before?

#### Plor
  
I had a job out of college where I worked for about seven years, up until 2017. When I left, that's when I immersed myself in this field, but I wasn't working in it directly yet. I tried a couple of projects but wasn't deeply involved. Then I took a job at a fintech startup, which coincidentally ties in with the smart invoice project I'm currently working on since we were dealing with invoice factoring. I was at that startup for about a year. A substantial part of my time at that job was spent checking crypto stuff on my personal computer, especially during the DeFi summer. I would do some work, then check my positions or how a particular token was doing. I was distracted and realized at some point it wasn't fair to continue this way. I left that job, dove in deeper, and not long after, joined RaidGuild.

#### Suede 
 
That sparks two questions. The first is do you want to tell us more about the smart invoice platform that you've been working on?

#### Plor
  
Smart Invoice originated from RaidGuild out of the need for us to get paid. When consulting with a client, you scope their work and then use an internal tool called Smart Escrow, which is just a layer on top of Smart Invoice. This requires the client to lock their funds in escrow, ensuring that the work you're doing has money backing it and you'll be compensated. The money is held in escrow while you complete the work, and when done, you ask for the funds to be released. The client doesn't pay upfront, preventing any risk of you running away with the money. If the work isn't delivered, they get their money back. But by locking it up, you have the assurance they can pay. We spun Smart Invoice off into its own project to avoid the issue of too many cooks in the kitchen with it running directly from Raid Guild. We're trying to spread the word and get people to use it because we want to prevent freelancers from being burned by non-paying clients and ensure clients get the work they paid for. The website is at smartinvoice.xyz, please check it out.

#### Suede 
 
I heard you say that during DeFi summer you were checking your investments. And I'm curious how that trading experience went for you. Did you control the FOMO?

#### Plor
  
I'm typically a bit conservative, I don't jump into the most degen things. I've done a lot with Compound, which had been around for a while. I also played around with Yams, Synthetics, and a few other projects, though I can't recall the exact timeline for all of these. But for me, the key is not to dive too deep into something I don't fully understand. I prefer to do a bit of research first. Ideally, it's something that's been around long enough that if it were going to rug pull, it would have already done so. I'm not an early adopter, per se, but I do look for opportunities to jump on. I'm open to some risks, but I also proceed with caution. I've been rug-pulled a couple of times, but generally, I think my track record is alright; I haven't made too many poor decisions.

#### Suede 
 
What would you say has been the biggest challenge that you have faced while integrating into Web3, the DAO ecosystem, and this decentralized way of working?

#### Plor
  
I think the biggest thing is the unpredictability of it. When I first started, it was during a bull run, and there were a multitude of projects to join. Then, things slowed down a bit and would fluctuate. So, sometimes you're too busy, other times you're not busy enough, and you have to find projects that can be slow burners, which you can put on the back burner for a while and get back to when you have extra time. And then also use the downtime to do other things, like making chili or gardening.

#### Suede 
 
How would you describe your current role at RaidGuild? In what capacity are you contributing?

#### Plor
  
Primarily, I'm fulfilling the role of a Monk, essentially a technical project manager. I join projects and serve as the point person for relaying the requirements to the developers, ensuring they are communicating effectively and documenting properly, and facilitating the coordination between them. My goal is to prevent any undue tossing of tasks "over the fence." I come from a development background, having worked as a Java developer and done some Ruby on Rails among other languages. When I arrived at RaidGuild, I noticed a lack of the type of project management I was accustomed to, I thought it would be beneficial for me to step into that role. That's mostly what I've been doing. I believe there's work to be done in better defining the Monk role and making it a well-functioning role within RaidGuild. But it's a step-by-step process.

#### Suede 
 
Do you remember your first raid or the first raid that you spearheaded? And would you tell us about it?

#### Plor
  
Yes, I think the first core project we worked on involved creating a bot that helped divide the funds among the raid party based on contribution. The first raid I was involved in was a streaming subscription service, where you could stream your funds to receive an NFT representing that stream. As long as you held the NFT, you could use the service. Once the stream stopped, the NFT would become inactive. It allowed for a yearly rate, but you could cut it off at any time.  

However, the project didn't go as smoothly as expected. We had some coordination issues, largely because we didn't have a Monk on that project. We delivered what we had, but it didn't progress to the next step of going to market. I don't believe it ever officially launched. I wasn't included in the follow-up steps, I'm uncertain about its current status. While it was a good learning experience, I'm unsure if it was fully successful in terms of execution.

#### Suede 
 
I'm hearing that you became a Monk at RaidGuild, because you saw a need for it, and that your first project did not have a Monk. What I'm hearing is that the role of a project manager is super important for success. Did I get that right?

#### Plor
  
Yes, I believe there are some distinctions to consider. For smaller raids, the overhead of a Monk might not be necessary. If there's limited coordination required between developers or if the project is simple, you might not need a separate Monk role. Someone else, perhaps a developer or a cleric, could handle it, essentially performing dual duty as a warrior-monk or cleric-monk.  

However, as a project grows, it becomes important to differentiate these roles, especially between the cleric and the monk. The cleric is more or less the representative of the client, while the monk represents the developers or the raid party. There's a balance to strike between delivering as much value as possible to satisfy the client and delivering what was promised without overextending ourselves to earn the amount due to us. Once a project reaches a certain size, I believe it's crucial to separate these roles.

#### Suede 
 
What advice would you give to freelancers who are brand-new to the Web3 space?

#### Plor
  
> **I believe the best approach is to dive in, join communities, and contribute wherever you can. There's a lot to learn, absorb as much as you can. Be consistent and deliver on your promises. As you learn, you'll be able to take on more responsibilities and build trust. With time, you'll be able to predict your workflow and make it sustainable. It requires some initial effort to get your bearings, but it's a crucial step.**  

> **In the Web3 world, you need to represent yourself and establish your position within the space, building on it progressively. It's different from working in a traditional company where you climb a hierarchical ladder. In this space, it's more about a web of different nodes, and your goal is to find the cluster you work well with.**

#### Suede 
 
How to find a community, how to choose.

#### Plor
  
Yes, and I'd also add that you don't have to limit yourself to just one community. You could join a couple of communities because there's an essential role for ambassadors who say, "Hey, I'm part of these two communities, and they can interact in this cool way." That's one of the advantages of this space; there's no need to fully commit or deal with non-compete clauses. 

> **You're free to work in several communities. Just be careful not to spread yourself too thin. For example, you could contribute to both RaidGuild and MetaCartel, identify where there's overlap, and make connections between them. I definitely recommend trying to be part of a couple of communities.**

#### Suede 
 
I heard you say, choose complementary communities, and be the connecting link between the two. That's great. That's brilliant. 

You mentioned MetaCartel, and I'm aware that along with DAOhaus and RaidGuild, these come out of the MolochDAO lineage. And I'm wondering if you want to say anything about that lineage. Is there something that you find attractive about that lineage?

#### Plor
  
Yes, I remember in the early days of MolochDAO, I followed it when it was making headlines, and it was incredibly intriguing. The ragequit functionality stood out to me as a fascinating feature that provided minority protection, which is absent in many DAOs. The non-transferability of shares also caught my attention, because it's not merely a speculative element. Your shares represent what you've earned or contributed in many cases.  

Though I'm not very well-versed in the MetaCartel side of things, I do know about the concept of forkability. MetaCartel itself was a fork from Moloch when Peter Pan wasn't accepted. It demonstrates a significant aspect of this space: if you're dissatisfied with something, or if there are disagreements, you're always free to create your own version or fork. Of course, you need to put in the work to make your fork successful.  

Then, I believe the MolochDAO funded DAOhaus and RaidGuild in its early days. DAOhaus is a platform for MolochDAOs to operate, and RaidGuild is one of the larger and more active service DAOs. That's my understanding of the MolochDAO ecosystem.

#### Suede 
 
Do you have any advice to give new apprentices that find their way to RaidGuild, and to the cohort process?

#### Plor
  
Some advice I'd give is to strive to understand the underlying technical aspects as best as you can, regardless of your role. It's always useful to have someone who can manage and draft proposals. This might involve working with DAOhaus tools or even interacting directly with contracts from Etherscan. You don't necessarily have to write in Solidity, but being able to formulate proposals or execute contracts is a valuable skill. Getting to the point where you can act as an operator, interacting with all the gears, is highly beneficial.  

I ended up doing a lot of this kind of work. For instance, I worked on migrating from DAOhaus V2 to V3 for RaidGuild, which involved managing proposals and navigating the quirks of the tool. Since these tools are still in their early stages, they're not always bug-free or perfectly polished. Sometimes, you need to find workarounds or use clever solutions.  

So, I recommend making yourself useful, and one way to do that is to become a super user of the tools we use.

#### Suede 
 
During the Season VI cohort, I observed that once the bounty spreadsheet was posted, there was a frantic rush with everyone trying to slot their names into all the columns. The entire process raised several questions: What project am I interested in? Who founded this project and what are they like? Who else is in this cohort and what skills do they possess? Who can I trust? Do you have any advice on how to navigate this process? Specifically, how can one join the right team and make a significant contribution? The goal, of course, is not only to enjoy the process but also to get noticed and ultimately voted into the guild. Do you have any insights on this matter?

#### Plor
  
Certainly, one aspect that perhaps wasn't emphasized enough in the bounty discussions is the role of the cleric. This role is akin to a product owner, and it could be incredibly beneficial if someone would step up for each bounty and take on the responsibility of a cleric. In doing so, they would be in charge of team building, determining who's going to work on what, and balancing roles. For instance, a team might not need five warriors but instead could benefit from a couple of designers. They would also need to gauge interest, identifying who's genuinely ready to invest effort into the project.  

Furthermore, there isn't necessarily a size limit to any of this. We could have numerous people working on a project, but there is a risk of spreading too thin. If individuals are dispersed across too many projects, their contributions may not be as meaningful.  

The cleric could potentially address this issue. If we were to use a similar cleric across all projects, they could caution people about overextending themselves. They could ask, "Are you sure you want to work on this project?"  

The cleric’s role is essential. But, it's also important not to try to do too much because of our limited attention. Attempting too much can lead to suboptimal results across all commitments, instead of doing the best job possible on a single project, which is more likely to get you noticed.  

Figure out the project that genuinely interests you, where you believe you can excel, and focus on that. If there's additional capacity, consider contributing to a secondary project, but it's not advisable to jump on all projects.

#### Suede 
 
That sounds like great advice. Plor, what are some of your philosophies, and core beliefs that help you to succeed in your work life, in RaidGuild and Web3? How do you show up? 

#### Plor
  
Indeed, my journey is a bit on the unique side. Early in my career, I became deeply involved with the Agile Manifesto and the entire Agile methodology, encompassing all the diverse practices therein. I sought to apply these principles wherever possible. This approach meant recognizing instances where we were perhaps over-planning or leaning too heavily on a waterfall planning technique, and then pulling back from that.  

I aimed to avoid relying excessively on the process itself, focusing instead on empowering people to take ownership of the tasks they wanted to handle. Adhering to the Agile Manifesto and adopting a more agile and lean mentality are central to my approach to work in this space, as well as programming in general.

#### Suede 
 
Say more.

#### Plor
  
Situational awareness is crucial. Although I've mostly heard it mentioned in military contexts, in terms of the OODA loop, it's also vital in other areas, including project management. This is one reason I favor Kanban for planning. Kanban provides a centralized view of the project's entire status. You can visually assess the health of a project at a glance without needing to delve into extensive details.  

Maintaining this holistic awareness allows for real-time updates and adaptations as things change, effectively enhancing the team's collective situational awareness. This way, everyone can understand where we are in the project, where we need to go, and how best to get there.

#### Suede 
 
Nice. In Web3 there is also a social layer. Can you say anything about how to show up on that social layer? How do you make yourself present, and visible on the social layer, and why is that important?

#### Plor
  
Being helpful is key. When people ask questions, if you know the answer or can obtain it quickly, then try to provide it. Ask your own questions, too. One principle we champion at Reveal is conducting everything in the open. Avoid excessive private messages or discussions taken offline. It's excellent to assist individuals privately, but if your assistance can be provided publicly and potentially benefit multiple people, that's even better.  

Remember, your contributions aren't just noise; they have value. Share useful information publicly and spread the benefits. If you find an interesting article, share it. However, I find it more valuable not to just share a link, but to provide context about why it's worth reading. A brief summary or a pointer towards an exciting part can turn a casual interest into a keen one.  

In general, strive to be helpful and participate in meetings actively. If you have an opinion, voice it. Often, we find that the same voices dominate meetings. While these active participants aren't doing anything wrong, different perspectives are always beneficial. Your unique viewpoint might introduce new ideas and help build better consensus at the team level.

#### Suede 
 
I'm hearing you say that a contrary opinion might be even more valuable.

#### Plor
  
Absolutely, my preference for contrary opinions is partly influenced by my own inclination towards diverse viewpoints. While this may seem self-serving, I firmly believe that identifying the range of opinions is one of the most productive things we can do.  

Take, for instance, the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The goal isn't necessarily to follow the majority opinion but rather to minimize discontent about a particular decision or direction. If everyone is relatively indifferent to two options, choosing the majority preference works just fine. However, if 25% of the people are strongly against something, proceeding with it may result in upsetting that significant minority.  

In contrast, choosing a direction that doesn't upset the dissenters could be a better choice. What we want to avoid is moving forward while continuously alienating people who aren't on the same page.  

> **It's not just about the direction of opinion; the intensity of that opinion also matters. Understanding whether someone strongly opposes an idea or is just mildly against it can make a substantial difference in decision-making processes.**

#### Suede 
 
I hear that. Plor, are you a member of any other DAOs besides RaidGuild?

#### Plor
  
In the past, I was a DAOhaus contributor. I'm a part of a couple of other DAOs, but I'm most active in RaidGuild.

#### Suede 
 
Trust and loyalty are important. In a DAO, some would say, they are the core cultural values that form the bedrock of the DAO ecosystem. Would you describe how trust and loyalty is generated and maintained? And, what are your thoughts on trust and loyalty?

#### Plor
  
> **There's a significant time component to both trust and loyalty. Trust is built over time, and loyalty is demonstrated over time. When you just meet someone, the concept of loyalty doesn't carry much weight. However, after knowing each other for years, loyalty becomes significant.**

The challenge in the DAO space is to involve people you don't know and provide them with enough room to start building trust over time. We use trustless tools to initiate their contributions, and as time progresses, more trust is built.  

For instance, in RaidGuild, we have a champion process for membership. A regular member, who has built trust over time, champions a new member, effectively transferring some of their earned trust to this newcomer.  

This method enables us to maintain a trusted DAO. Instead of allowing anyone to join by simply purchasing a token, we establish trust through this championing process. However, it's equally important that we have trustless tools to work without immediate trust. This flexibility allows for a more dynamic community where members can leave, return, or new members can join and contribute effectively without having initially established that trust.

#### Suede 
 
What do you think the future of coordination looks like? Are we going to be able to coordinate and slay Moloch using this Web3 blockchain experiment?

#### Plor
  
While I don't believe that Moloch will be permanently defeated, I do think we can ward it off over time. As our coordination tools improve, we can perform more refined tasks. Right now, the level of coordination requires fairly large operations. If the task isn't big enough, the overhead of the process, such as creating a proposal to build something, becomes too wasteful.  

However, as we continue to improve and refine our tools, we can reduce the granularity of tasks. This improvement allows us to coordinate with trustless tools in ways that can prevent more instances where Moloch might come into play.  

For example, tools that incorporate staking for commitments can help alleviate potential defection problems. If someone pledges they're going to do something, they put something on the line. It makes the prospect of finding a better way to defect from a commitment less likely because they have skin in the game.  

> **I believe we need a variety of tools like these, with lower granularity, so they can be easily implemented as a deterrent against Moloch.**

#### Suede 
 
What are your final thoughts? Is there anything else you'd like the community to know?

#### Plor
  
One point I didn't touch on earlier involves privacy and anonymity in the space. While I didn't completely embrace this — I go by Plor, but my identity isn't entirely concealed — I believe there's value in it. If I were to start over, I might consider keeping my Web3 persona completely separate from my real-life identity.  

> **Developing ways and tools to facilitate this kind of privacy is extremely valuable. We should encourage it, ensuring we can work effectively with anonymous contributors. It's crucial that we accept contributions from anyone who wishes to maintain their privacy.**

#### Suede 
 
Say more about that. Why is it important for people to remain anonymous? How does that benefit this whole movement where we are trying to level the playing field?

#### Plor
  
There are several reasons why maintaining anonymity can be beneficial in this space. It mitigates the risks associated with being identified by nation-states. The actions you undertake today could potentially have repercussions in the future. An example could be a developer of a project like Tornado Cash getting arrested. Staying anonymous and untraceable can help you avoid such scenarios.  

Privacy can preserve your safety. Crypto can be highly lucrative, and successful projects can result in significant wealth. Anonymity can protect you from potential physical threats or robberies, commonly known as 'wrench attacks.'  

Anonymity can also facilitate freedom of speech. If your real identity is tied to your words or actions, you may feel inhibited, fearing potential backlash. You might avoid building a tool due to the risks associated with it being shut down by authorities, or you might refrain from voicing an opinion out of fear of public backlash.  

Disconnecting your personal self from your Web3 identity can reduce these constraints. It provides a sense of confidence that it's the anonymous persona, not you, who would bear the consequences of those actions. This separation can significantly reduce self-censorship and promote freedom of speech.       

#### Suede 
 
Thank you Plor! It's been a pleasure to talk with you.
